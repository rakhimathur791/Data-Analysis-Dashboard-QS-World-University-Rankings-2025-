 ## Project Objectives  
•	To identify the factors that most strongly influence university rankings and overall performance.  
•	To measure the correlation between various metrics and overall score.  
•	To analyse trends in university rankings over time and identify rising and declining institutions.  
•	To categorize and visualize universities based on research output, sustainability, and other performance indicators.  
•	To present findings through interactive Excel dashboards and visual storytelling for easier interpretation.  
## Process
•	Collect and clean QS ranking data.  
•	Calculate ranking changes year over year.  
•	Analyze key metrics like reputation, faculty ratios, and sustainability.  
•	Use pivot tables and charts to explore trends.  
•	Perform correlation analysis.  
•	Visualize insights on rankings, regional strengths, and university performance.

 ## Project Insight
•	Academic Reputation scores demonstrate a very strong correlation of 0.90 with overall scores, highlighting their significant influence in the QS methodology.  
•	Employer Reputation scores show a strong correlation of 0.78 with overall scores, reinforcing their important role in the QS methodology.  
•	Academic Reputation and Employer Reputation show a strong positive correlation of 0.86, indicating that universities with higher academic prestige also tend to have better employer reputation scores.  
•	Faculty-Student Score shows a negative correlation of -0.42 with university rankings, implying that institutions with lower Faculty-Student Scores (i.e., smaller faculty-to-student ratios) tend to rank higher.  
•	International Faculty Score shows a positive correlation of 0.35 with the Overall Score, suggesting their mild positive influence in determining institutional rankings.   
•	Analysis by country and region reveals that top-ranked universities are primarily concentrated in the United States, the United Kingdom, and parts of Asia, with institutions from these areas excelling in academic reputation, employer reputation, and research output  
•	African universities tend to have lower rankings but show potential for improvement with increased focus on internationalization and research collaboration.  
•	Technische Universität Bergakademie Freiberg has made the most significant improvement in its ranking, rising from 1401 in 2024 to 380 in 2025, a remarkable climb of 1021 positions.  
•	On the other hand, Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería Peru has experienced the largest decline in its ranking, falling from 951 in 2024 to 1201 in 2025, a drop of 250 positions.  
## Final Conclusion
The QS Rankings data reveals that institutional reputation and research impact are the most influential factors in global university rankings. While infrastructure metrics like student-to-faculty ratio and sustainability play important roles, it’s the academic and employer perceptions that dominate score contributions. Through this project, we gain a clearer understanding of how various performance indicators interact, allowing universities, policymakers, and students to make more informed decisions. Advanced Excel tools proved highly effective in uncovering patterns, trends, and correlations, making this a powerful method for data-driven academic benchmarking.
